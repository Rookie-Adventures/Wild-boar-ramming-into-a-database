"I have no coding background, so if I accidentally make mistakes, I deeply apologize as it's not intentional.

Like a wild boar charging into a farm, I may not always be aware of the damage I cause.

I would greatly appreciate your understanding and guidance, rather than your hunting rifle.

Thank you for your patience."
